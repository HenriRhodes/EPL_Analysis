The purpose of this project was to join two passions, football and analysis and do some exploratory analysis on an kaggle dataset I found containing data on Premier League games spanning 20+years.
I used installed python into a .venv and used VS code in order to explore and interrogate the csv files i had downloaded. 
Having had a biref look i did some initial plots to have a look at referees and cards given in individual seasons.

Then decided to concatenate all of the seasons together into a large dataframe and clean the data in order to see if there were any broader trends. 
Then i exported the larger clean df as a csv and am now working on a dashboard in Power BI in order to dive deeper.

I intend to work on this to explore insights on the affect of the introduction of VAR into the Premier league. Whilst taking Covid postponed matches and the psychological impact of reduced crowds on players during those seasons.
