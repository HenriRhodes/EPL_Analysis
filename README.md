The purpose of this project was to join two passions, football and analysis and do some exploratory analysis on an kaggle dataset I found containing data on Premier League games spanning 20+years.
I used installed python into a .venv and used VS code in order to explore and interrogate the csv files I had downloaded. 
Having had a brief look I did some initial plots to have a look at referees and cards given in individual seasons.

Then decided to concatenate all of the seasons together into a large dataframe and clean the data in order to see if there were any broader trends. 
Then I exported the larger clean df as a csv and am now working on a dashboard in Power BI in order to dive deeper.

On a closer inspection whilst the dip during the Covid pandemic of Yellow Cards would make sense, the data is incomplete. We are missing 7 months worth of matches during 2020 ![image](https://github.com/HenriRhodes/EPL_Analysis/assets/146751862/7e35b574-03e9-467f-af02-37cdf513c6b2)
