The purpose of this project was to do some exploratory analysis on an kaggle dataset I found containing data on Premier League games spanning 20+years
I used installed python into a .venv and used VS code in order to explore and interrogate the csv files i had downloaded. 
Having had a biref look i did some initial plots to have a look at referees and cards given in individual seasons
Then decided to concatenate all of the seasons together into a large dataframe and clean the data in order to see if there were any broader trends. 
Then i exported the larger clean df as a csv and am now working on a dashboard in Power BI in order to dive deeper.
